# Project-X V2

DNA Mutation At A Quantum Level - It's not rocket science!
also informally called x-menlevelbiology because they're mutants and this project is on DNA mutation... I think I'm hilarious.

The goal of this project is to provide a simplified explaination of how DNA mutation would differ in animals at a quantum level. As well as publish a research paper on the topic with the opinions of experts in it.

It's not rocket science, it's biology!
